# My Dynamic Programming Challenges

This repository is my personal collection of dynamic programming challenges and solutions. It's a space where I work through various algorithmic problems, both from well-known algorithm repositories and other interesting challenges I come across.

## What's Inside

The repository is organized by programming language and problem type. Here's a quick look at what you'll find:

### Python Solutions

- **Dynamic Programming**:
  - `catalan.py`: Implements different methods to calculate Catalan numbers.
  - `factorial.py`: Computes factorials.
  - `climbing_stairs.py`: Solves the climbing stairs problem.

### JavaScript Solutions

- **Dynamic Programming**:
  - `catalan.js`: Implements different methods to calculate Catalan numbers.
  - `factorial.js`: Computes factorials.
  - `fibonacci.js`: Solves the Fibonacci sequence problem.
  - `climbing_stairs.js`: Solves the climbing stairs problem.

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to practice and improve my skills in various CS topics and make up for my lack of CS background :D 

Happy coding!
